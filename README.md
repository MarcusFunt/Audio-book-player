# Audio-book-player

A fully client-side audiobook player built for GitHub Pages. Load local MP3 files, save your listening position per profile, and use a sleep timer without any server.

## Features
- Local MP3 playback with progress tracking.
- Lightweight profile system (optional PIN) stored in browser storage.
- Resume prompt for previously played files on the same device.
- Adjustable playback speed, volume, and sleep timer.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static server.
2. Create or sign in to a profile.
3. Choose an MP3 file from your device to begin listening.

> **Note**: Because this is hosted on GitHub Pages, the app cannot access files unless you select them each session. The app remembers the last file name and position so you can quickly resume by choosing the same file again.
